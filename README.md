## Features

- Powerful system menu (SUPER + U)
- System wide themes
- Aesthetic widgets powered by <a href="https://github.com/Ewwii-sh/ewwii/tree/main">ewwii</a>
- Auto-install script (designed for Arch-based distros)

## Requirements

**Recommended base**: Arch Linux or Arch-based distro (EndeavourOS, Manjaro, etc.).

**Optional/hardware**:
- NVIDIA users: proprietary `nvidia-dkms` often required.
- Ensure `multilib` enabled on Arch if you need 32-bit libs for some apps.

## How to install?

I highly recommend using [Chaotic AUR](https://aur.chaotic.cx/docs)

Run this command to install:
```
curl -fsSL -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BukoMoon/niribinarydots/refs/heads/main/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

# Installing manually (For non-Arch based distros)

» You have to install all the dependencies from your package manager.

» Copy folders inside config and scripts folder itself to your `~/.config` folder
